<h1>Horiseon</h1>

<p>As a media marketing agency Horiseon wanted a webpage that met accessibility standards and was optimized for search engines</p>

<h2>Changes Made</h2>

<p>Replaced unnecessary div tags and used the correct semantic tags such as section, figure, nav, and header tags in a logical structure. Alt attributes were added for consumers who may use screen readers and other aids used to view the webpage, changes were also made to the heading tags for a more logically structured and in sequential order. The final modification made was giving the webpage a descriptive title.
